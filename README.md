# BettaHealth.py
A program to analyze a betta fish's health based on a symptoms quiz.
The program asks the user to take the quiz, then returns what is most
likely to be the betta's illness. It then displays information about the
disease, a chart of the quiz results to see if it could possibly be a different
disease, and amazon links for possible treatments which are provided by
a microservice created by my partner in this project. The program also provides
a list of the other common betta illnesses and information on them as well
as products to help them.

To srat the program, start the Amazon_list_REP.py file first to
activate the microservice, then the main.py file.
